Make sure you have started you have set up your environment correctly. After cloning the GitHub repo and entering the appâ€™s directory, install all the dependencies using npm install, globally install the JSON server by typing npm install -g json-server and run the server using npm run serve .

The JSON server contains our username â€˜Batmanâ€™ and the password â€˜bruceâ€™, alongwith the fake tweets. Without the server running, our app wonâ€™t be able to verify the userâ€™s credential.

Please let me know if this works.
