This International Women's Day I **#ChooseToChallenge** and call out gender bias and inequality.

As someone who works in the tech industry, I feel we are all trying to achieve some ambitious goals. When the goals are so ambitious, we cannot let other narrow-minded people who discriminate against people based on their gender hinder the progress, especially when we can reach the goals much faster when **everyone** participates and helps each other out. 

In our industry, there are many incidents where women are judged on their looks, what they wear, theme-color they've chosen, anything but their actual work. There's also a concerning pay gap between men and women who have the same set of skills. If you think about it, you can only have respect for the top women leaders that have to go through all these and **also** perfect their craft.

So what can we do to level the playing field? 
- For one, I have definitely decided to call out gender bias and discrimination wherever I see it. Not even in the jokes, because those are what normalize it.

- Have a lot more conversations around this, there should be more awareness about the topic so that it doesn't happen again.
