The SCP command, or secure copy, enables secure file transfers between a local host and a remote host, or between two remote hosts. For cases where you have data on the remote server and want to transfer it to your local machine, `scp`works perfectly for those scenarios. Here's an example of how to use it:

```bash
scp ubuntu@<ip-address>:/home/ubuntu/Scripts/filename.csv .
```

Breaking down the example

| Syntax | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Username | `ubuntu` |
| IP address of the host | &lt;ip-address&gt; |
| Location of file on host | `/home/ubuntu/Scripts/filename.csv` |
| Destination | . (current directory) |

ðŸ’¡ TIP: You can also press `tab` to see what files are there in the remote directory and then proceed to choose the file
