## Data Wrangling with JavaScript update: Free copy of the ebook up for grabs!


The early access program (MEAP) for my book [Data Wrangling with JavaScript](http://bit.ly/2t2cJu2) was updated last week! The first 7 chapter are now available, with more chapters to come.

In addition, two new chapters have been approved by Manning. One chapter is Live Data, which is about working with continuous streaming data in your production server. The other chapter is Advanced Visualization with D3, which is a nice complement to the existing visualization chapters.

To celebrate the update, Manning has offered up a copy of the ebook (with subscription to the early access program), so I need to find someone to receive a free copy of the book!

I thought we might do it as a raffle! 

**Please leave a comment on this page and tell me how you want to use JavaScript for your data wrangling, analysis or visualization project. Otherwise, you can tell me how the book will help you learn data wrangling with JavaScript. Please write at least one paragraph, but don't be afraid to write more.** 

In a week I'll draw the prize at random from clearly written and meaningful responses. 

[You can read the first chapter for free](http://bit.ly/2t2cJu2).
