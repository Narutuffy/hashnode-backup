Paxos, Greece

There are few things in life I love more than [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io) and none of them are also in tech 🧡 And my love only grew further this week, when I found out you can now use it as a GraphQL server, pretty much superseding the functionality of the deprecated Apollo Launchpad. The Apollo team themselves actually use Code Sandbox in their [excellent docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/)!

All you need is to spin one up by hitting [https://codesandbox.io/s/apollo-server](https://codesandbox.io/s/apollo-server), modifying it to return the data you wish, and then create a new sandbox with an Apollo client pointing to the uri you’ll find in the playground.

%[https://codesandbox.io/s/cute-dog-picture-generator-tph85?codemirror=1&amp;fontsize=14&amp;hidenavigation=1&amp;module=%2Fsrc%2FapolloClient.ts&amp;highlights=4,5,6]


The future is now!

And if the “all you need to do” part actually seems like a lot of work, please spare five minutes and follow along as I break down you how **you too** can create your very own GraphQL layer with Code Sandbox, and use it to serve a frontend client you’ve created in a different one.

## The server

As mentioned above, the first thing is to hit [https://codesandbox.io/s/apollo-server](https://codesandbox.io/s/apollo-server) which will get you started with a server that resolves a `hello` query. You may use the playground on the right to autocomplete your way into confirming it does return “Hello world!”.

(If you’re not familiar with GraphQL queries, all you’d need is `{ hello }`)

You may modify your schema and resolvers in the code pane to return some hardcoded data just to get your UI going, or you could be cool and proxy through an existing RESTful API.

I enjoy perusing the handy [public-apis Github repo](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) and the one that caught my eye this time was the [Dogs API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) based on the Stanford Dogs Dataset. So let’s update our `typeDefs` to return an array of breeds!

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/8bf40a18e70845423d3475824eee5dad]


If you now try to run a `{ breeds }` query on the playground, you’ll get an error, as we have not implemented a resolver for it. So let’s try hitting the [https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all) endpoint! It seems it’s returning a map of all the breeds with their sub-breeds, all inside a `message` property.

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/2117a725b3a7c42637729e6d7adf4a37]


(we’ve brought in `node-fetch` as a dependency so we can use the familiar fetch API from the browser on the server-side. Your app should initially crash as that dependency is not installed, but Code Sandbox is smart enough to ask if you want to install it; all you have to do is click a button!)

I’ve put the above in a new file, `breeds.js` so let’s bring it in our `index.js` and use it in place of the default `hello` resolver:

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/27f447c4f85b504f7ad47de2ce346b02]


Trying to run our query in the playground again, we should be getting a different problem: “Expected Iterable, but did not find one for field Query.breeds”… Of course, we’ve defined we’ll be returning an array, but what we’re actually returning is an object!

GraphQL does not support dynamic keys so we can’t do anything too clever on the `typeDefs` side: we will have to modify our `breeds.js` to actually do return an array of strings. An easy way out if you’re in a rush would be to just `Object.keys(message)` in the end, which will get you an array of all the breeds, but if you’d like the sub-breeds as well, you may try something like this:

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/0b1eabd68eaa659aaa0f92b2358cdc31]


Either way, if you now rerun the query in the playground, you should finally be getting some actual data!

Great!

You may notice that the playground’s uri is an actual link you can hit on any browser and get that same playground. Mine above is [https://5bdjw.sse.codesandbox.io/](https://5bdjw.sse.codesandbox.io/) but try it out with the one you ended up with!

… does that mean we can give that uri to any GraphQL client and it will properly respond to our queries with data?

## The client

The answer is yes! Let’s get started with the [React + TS](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-ts) template Code Sandbox offers: [https://codesandbox.io/s/react-ts](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-ts)

Using `apollo-boost` and thanks to its plethora of implicit dependencies, we’ll be done with our `apolloClient.ts` with just a few lines of code:

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/ec01e38028126837c041dc01e76cf60b]


(Again, Code Sandbox will crash because of lacking dependencies, just keep clicking the button to add them until it’s happy)

With that file written, we may hook up our `App.tsx` with an ApolloProvider!

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/f951590866e83c230ee3f456c56ba651]


And with an ApolloProvider, we may write a component to render inside it that runs a GraphQL query our `apolloClient` can satisfy! Let’s create a select dropdown listing all our dog breeds!

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/d26c567ccfe906d2144076871d717e6f]


Finally, let’s use it in `App.tsx`.

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/34e35d2ed7ea40c081842a097762113a]


If you look at the embedded browser, you should be getting something not too shabby!

![🎉🎉🎉](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*O2IdyhqVi0nM_y-2HvfiZg.png)*🎉🎉🎉*

So **you’ve already** done Fullstack Javascript + GraphQL with Code Sandbox! Woohoo! Was it actually 5' for you? I’d love to know!

In any case, how about we feature creep a little bit and get a cute picture of a dog on the page? You should be more comfortable with the process by now!

## Updating the schema and adding a resolver

So back in the server sandbox, we’ll update our `typeDefs` with the new thing we want: A query that returns a string, an image link, when given the string of a breed.

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/018dc999f0908c32958694142c05a984]


Simple enough! Now to implement the resolver: according to the [dog docs](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/breed), hitting [https://dog.ceo/api/breed/VALID_BREED_HERE/images/random](https://dog.ceo/api/breed/VALID_BREED_HERE/images/random) will get us a`json` payload again, with a random picture for that breed in its `message` key. It is sub-breeds that are slightly more complicated again, as you need to hit [https://dog.ceo/api/breed/BREED/SUBBREED/images/random](https://dog.ceo/api/breed/VALID_BREED_HERE/images/random)…

Still, figuring out the path isn’t crazy:

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/02087ffa8a86abd2eeeef1f69ff9974f]


But wait a minute! Why is `breed` the second parameter of the method, and destructured from an object at that?!

It’s how resolvers work: they get called with the whole resolved object so far as the first parameter (so nothing in our case), the arguments object of the query to resolve, and the context object, where you’d usually put stuff like authentication, or the stores that fetch your models or whatever fancy thing we won’t be using here.

All we care about is the arguments object, which for this query would be things like `{ breed: 'frise bichon' }`.

So let’s import and add that resolver alongside the one we made for breeds:

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/9e385fd9f5900364cb6e5fa1a9a13461]


With that, server-side is all sorted! Give it a go in the playground and query for something like:

```
{
 randomPictureForBreed(breed: "frise bichon")
}
```


You should be getting back the link to a cute image, which isn’t nearly as good as **seeing** the cute image itself. So let’s go back to the client and use our new resolver!

## A useQuery with variables

So, client-side we need to do the trickiest thing of the article: Implement a component that queries as above, but with a dynamic breed.

It’s not **too** tricky. It is similar to our `BreedSelector.tsx` but we’ll be passing variables when we’re calling `useQuery`; passing variables to methods is our bread and butter, so that’s not the tricky part!

The `gql` query itself is the one that has a very specific and weird syntax. You need to explicitly declare you’re writing a query and name it, so you can define it’ll be called with a variable, and then use that dynamic variable calling the `randomPictureForBreed` resolver.

This is very GraphQL specific so don’t worry too much about it; consider the following code and it will make more sense the more you use it, as with most things 😄

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/054607d53c09bedc0975a9e3a1aa03e5]


So we have the component we always wanted! Let’s render it in our `App.tsx` with a hardcoded prop and get the payoff of a cute picture to keep us going!

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/7fabd83c7bd87f27aa24b0438bffceec]


What happens in the browser preview???

![🎉🎉🎉](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2616/1*U7IJGONwPVXiNroAHrIUIg.png)*🎉🎉🎉*

Noice! We didn’t implement that dropdown earlier just for the funsies though, so let’s connect it to what we’re displaying by introducing some app state!

## useState and go live

Because would people even read a current React blogpost that doesn’t use hooks? Well, tell you what, we were using hooks all along, with `useQuery` from Apollo, so this shouldn’t be too hard!

Our goal is for the `BreedSelector` to be getting the same `breed` our `RandomPictureForBreed` gets, with the ability to change it when the user selects a different breed from its dropdown. Looks like a job for their common parent, `App`!

Let’s keep track of the `selectedBreed` there, and give `BreedSelector` the way to set it!

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/72804dff08a046476ecdff8695ad6343]


We’re also giving `selectedBreed` to `RandomPictureForBreed` in place of our hardcoded value, and only rendering it if it’s truthy; that query will never work with an empty string as the breed, so it doesn’t make sense to render it before something has been selected.

The last thing we need to do is to have `BreedSelector` expect and use those new props!

%[https://gist.github.com/jmagrippis/9568cf4e6d8461924e53798ba9863de9]


Play around with the dropdown in the embedded browser for the final payoff!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2236/1*uXwPdgZ1iplMIeqjj2SfnA.png)

Woohoo! Let’s take a moment to pat ourselves in the back. We’ve all been such good boys / girls 🐶

## The end?

With cute dog pictures the sky is the limit, but this should be enough functionality for an MVP. I’ve embedded the [Code Sandbox for the client](https://codesandbox.io/s/cute-dog-picture-generator-tph85) all the way up at the start of this post, and here’s the sandbox for the server.

%[https://codesandbox.io/s/open-source-dogs-api-graphql-layer-5bdjw?codemirror=1&amp;fontsize=14&amp;hidenavigation=1&amp;highlights=7,8,9,10,11]


If the frontend looks different, it’s because I’ve messed with the styles a little bit using [Material-U](https://material-ui.com/)I and [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/), for the funsies. I am also doing a bit of rudimentary error handling and refetching. Would you be interested in a play by play on that, or maybe you’d want to know more about…

## The tests

My initial goal before I fell down this rabbit hole of Code Sandbox awesomeness was just to scaffold code examples to then showcase how you’d test React components that leverage an `ApolloProvider` in a more “integration-y” way, using the excellent [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/).

I thought the above was interesting enough to warrant at least one post focusing just on it!

So let me know what you think of it, and whether you’d find one focusing on the tests useful, as well as subscribe / follow / whatever you do in Medium to be notified when it is published 😄

Or just go forth and keep trying things out; no pressure!
