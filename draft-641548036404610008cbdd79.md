* What was the issue, how we came across it
    
    We recently had an issue on prod where a few users faced an error while accessing their settings page. What's interesting about this error is, it was happening randomly to a few users and was not consistently reproducible.
    

* From the logs, it was just easy to add the check directly and it actually solved the problem
    
* I could end the article here but I was very curious
    
* Curious about why it actually happened on the first req but didn't later on
    
    * In cases like these I am pretty sure that there'a a caching layer interfering
        
    * How I tried to replicate the bug and why it was happening only to some users
        
* Checked redis sessionMiddleware which wasn't actually the culprit
    
* Almost sure that it was the reason why, we had `pro.` on
    
* Then I tried to remove it and still it was working then I fucking saw that .lean was being used
