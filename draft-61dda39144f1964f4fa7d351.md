One of the biggest pain points for me while starting a side project is starting things from scratch. So I decided to stick with a stack for all my future projects and focus on executing things faster. There are new frameworks coming up every now and then (looking at you, remix) but I decided to stick with Next.js because my development speed is fastest with that and we also use that at work (this beautiful platform), so it is easier for me to transfer learnings back and forth between my work and side projects.  Finally, these are the technologies I chose: 
- Next.js for frontend
- Inbuilt serverless functions as backend (Next.js)
- PostgreSQL with Prisma (I'm spoiled by ORMs)
- Next-Auth for authentication
- Vercel for deployment
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

In this guide, we'll also set up Heroku's free PostgreSQL for development.
