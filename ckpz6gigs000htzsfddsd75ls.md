## Web Databased Database Designer


This is just a web development toy, I found a year or so ago and find it very helpful when designing large scalable application's since you can graphically draw out your Database design on a grid paper and even export it as MySQL to insert into your project.

Anyway I keep losing the link so I figure'd I would salute the people that made this fine [application](http://dbdsgnr.appspot.com/app). 

Try it out,  I find it very helpful on projects with n to n relationships or one to many table relationships.

Anyway there's a new toy to play with enjoy. Thanks for making it :)
