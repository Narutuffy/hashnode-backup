A quick way to insert code for your medium stories.

Easiest of all is to embed your code ``` . This allows embedding your code as :

```
//Your code
def hello_world():
    print('hello world')
```

Make sure you press enter so that you see the below symbol before you start typing ```

But this approach would get tricky if you are embedding code which needs an indentation. Hence we can use Github gist.

1. Go to [https://gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com).

1. Add your code in the gist.

1. On your top right you will see the

4. Click on Embed drop down and select `Share` , this should give you an url something like

````
[https://gist.github.com/akhilanandbv003/fd4f3898bb7b9c36f7b9a8c198e01548](https://gist.github.com/akhilanandbv003/fd4f3898bb7b9c36f7b9a8c198e01548)```
````

Paste it in your article and press enter. Hazzaaa!!

<iframe
                width="0"
                height="0"
                src=""
                frameborder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen
              ></iframe>

Hope this helps!
