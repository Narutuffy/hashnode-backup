### What was the bug, how we came across it?

We recently had an issue on prod where a few users faced an error while accessing their settings page or dashboard page. What's interesting about this error is:

* It was happening randomly to a few users and was not consistently reproducible.
    
* It was also happening only on the first request for them
    

The logs showed the following error:

Says that `.hasProAcces` is `undefined` in `_document.js` file. Digging more, we found that we had added a field as `isPro: req.user?.pro.hasProAccess` in one of the objects we are using.

So simply adding a check for `pro` will do the trick. We added that and observed that it solved the problem.

We can end the article here on debugging but I was quite curious to know what actually transpired. I needed the answers for How it is erroring out only in the first request but rest of the requests were fine? Why is it only happening to a few users?

### Bug Hunting

Since it was only happening to a few users and on the first request, I suspected that it was related to some caching layer in between. Our backend uses `express` and `express-session` middleware with `redis` to manage user sessions.

So, the hypothesis was, the users who already had their session cached didn't face this error but new users (or users whose session expired) had this issue. To test this locally, I'll have to delete my session and see if I can reproduce this error. You know what they say, half the debugging is over when you are able to reproduce the error (I don't know if they actually did, I'm saying that). I cleared the local redis cache and then reverted the patch we had applied. I was able to reproduce the error ðŸŽ‰

On second refresh, it was again working properly. How was this working? So on first request as the user request was not cached in `sessionMiddleware`, the code path was different. Here's what was going on:

We have an `attemptToAutoLogin` middleware function which tries to populate `req.user` with the logged in user data using cookies when there's

* Curious about why it actually happened on the first req but didn't later on
    
    * In cases like these I am pretty sure that there'a a caching layer interfering
        
    * How I tried to replicate the bug and why it was happening only to some users
        
* Checked redis sessionMiddleware which wasn't actually the culprit
    
* Almost sure that it was the reason why, we had `pro.` on
    
* Then I tried to remove it and still it was working then I fucking saw that .lean was being used
