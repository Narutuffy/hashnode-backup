## Do you Remember the Middle Class Citizen?



American, the land of used to be opportunity,  Where you once a Middle Class citizen?  A person that maybe owned a business or at least made enough money to live comfortable?  I remember those days,  it wasn't long ago that this country was the highest exporting country on the globe.  Now all we export is illegal aliens apparently and we don't even do that correctly.



The problem with this country, is not just the useless politicians that get there kickbacks from the lobbyist,  Its not the huge drug manufacturers that create Synthetic Heron and give it to anyone with a broken finger nail ( yes that would be you Purdue, Roche, and Watson )



It's mainly the Super Stores, Mainly Walmart,  Walmart has 2.1 billion employee's that are payed 5-10 dollars a hour.  Can you live on 10 dollars a hour? I can't and I won't.  Did you know that every every minute there is 1.1 purchases made at Walmart world wide.  Where does this money go?  Not to the American workers that's for sure.  The money goes to China,  from 2001 to 2006 over 12 billion American dollars were sent to China from YOUR purchases at Walmart.



Did you know that In 2000, Walmart was sued 4,851 times -- about once every 2 hours.



How about Walmart is battling 1.6 million employees in the largest class action sex discrimination law suit ever -- the potential cost is $11 billion.  



How this interesting tidbit The Walton family has given away about 2% of its net worth to charity -- Bill Gates is giving away 48% of his net worth and Warren Buffet 78% of his net worth.



2% of his net worth.  Impressive Bill Gates gives more money to Charity then the largest corporation in the Entire World,  Thats pretty pathetic honestly, the man who Holds a monopoly on the Computer Market which was GIVEN to him by IBM on a Silver plater gives more money to Charity then the Walton Family.



Anyway to conclude this little lesson on our current economic situation,  Every time you make a purchase at Walmart think of where those dollars are going.  Do they goto a honest American Worker? Or does the money goto to some Rich fucks family who doesn't care about anything but getting richer and destroying our country?  



People wake up,  This is our country,  we built it only to watch it fall to shite in less then 200 years?  Our founding fathers our rolling in there graves at this pathetic country we call America.  Take back our country, stop sending your money to China.  Buy American,  Hire Americans that actually went through the process of becoming legal.
