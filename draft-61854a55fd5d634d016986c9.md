I recently built [ogmeta](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ogmeta/nlefkaegoaoffmnffehjmbgdknmegcaf), so I thought of writing a blog on it before I forget the steps. Chrome extensions basically have the following core concepts:

- Manifest File
- Type of Extension (Popup, Devtools)

You can view all your extensions by entering`chrome://extensions` as URL
