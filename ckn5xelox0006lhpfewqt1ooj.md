## Bonfire Series On Hold While working on new merge


I hope everybody has found the guides I wrote for CodeIgniter's Bonfire web development admin thingamabab,  Since the .6 push is in full swing now, and it's looking bossed up, I suggest everyone git down on some Bootstrap CSS tricks and tip's, maybe make your snippet box ready to spit out some sexy mark-up.  Anyway this just a rambling post so you really should be going over to [Bonfire](http://www.cibonfire.com) .
