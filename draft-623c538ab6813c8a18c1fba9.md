Like any other header, a cookie is also a header that web apps use to store essential information. If you want to clear a cookie from server-side in Next.js (which uses node.js under the hood) you can simply use response's `setHeader` method like so:

    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'some-cookie=someValue; Max-Age=0');
    

The important part is setting `Max-Age=0`, which will make the browser delete that cookie immediately.

PS: This will work for other frameworks and languages too, syntax might be different but Headers work in the same way across all browsers
