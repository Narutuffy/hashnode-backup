## Make Your Logged JSON Readable


I am tired of logging JSON and seeing `[Object]` or `[Array]` on my terminal.

So I set out on a mission to do something about it. Enter [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq), a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. You can follow the installation guide in the [docs](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) for your OS.

Now all you have to do is `console.log(JSON.stringify(data))` and pipe the command you run to jq. Like shown below:

```
node index.js | jq
```


Which will output this beautiful JSON âœ¨ that we wanted in the first place.
