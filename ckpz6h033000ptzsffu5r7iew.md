## Git goodies for a faster git workflow



As I've grown to love GIT and decided that life is much better with it, and life would be a whole lot
better if you could manage yours using GIT (I donnu git clone me or git fork me lol) anyway over the
few years I have been using GIT now,  I've found and collected a bunch of various helpers that improve my
daily work flow with it.

Since I suffer from Short term memory loss apparently and I also like to share what I find useful to me
, I've decided maybe some of my readers might find a few of these tools helpful to you,  I normally use
Debian or Mac for a OS so I'm not sure if much of this will be useful to my windows readers, but for us
Command Line Junkies then a lot of this will be very helpful, There's some aliases, some config changes,
and then there's the real hard-core packages and gem's that I just can't live without anymore.

O, if you haven't watched **Tech Talk: Linus Torvalds on git** then I highly suggest it.

## Aliases and my Global Config file Template.

I lost most of my aliases in my last hard-drive crash, so I have to rebuild them!  I will add my aliases file from my office CPU when I go into the office though.

## List of boss GIT helpers.

### [**Git-extras**](https://github.com/visionmedia/git-extras)

 - Adds a lot of useful, and handy commands for managing your git repos.
 - Mostly Bash Scripts so will work anywhere Bash is included and that should be anywhere you're going to develop at.
 - Watch the video if you want to see some of the commands, or just head over to the repo and read the list of commands and what they do.

### [**Random Git Scripts**](https://github.com/jcanfield/git-scripts)

 This is just a collection of Random Git Bash and Ruby Scripts, that I found useful.

### [**Git-flow**](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)

This is probably one of the best branching model's I've used, it did have a little bit of a learning curve, so I'll give you some links that I read to help me understand it better.

 - [**A successful Git branching model**](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
 - [**Why aren't you using git-flow**](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/)

You should probably also go ahead and get the Bash Git-flow [**Completionn**](http://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion) files also.

There's also a Github flow that was recently released highly suggested if you havent already started with gitflow.

 There's also some screen-cast's that might help for the visual learners.
