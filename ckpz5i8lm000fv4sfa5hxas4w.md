## Announcing Data-Forge Notebook


Today I'm announcing my new product for data analysis, transformation and visualization in JavaScript!

For some years now I've been on a mission to improve the state of data analysis in JavaScript. After discovering the friction of working with data in JS, I started on the path of developing [Data-Forge](http://www.data-forge-js.com/). Next came my book [Data Wrangling with JavaScript](http://bit.ly/2t2cJu2).

Now I present to you my latest endeavour: [Data-Forge Notebook](http://www.data-forge-notebook.com/). This a notebook-style application for data transformation, analysis and visual prototyping in JavaScript. It's kind of like a REPL on steroids. It's a desktop app and it works on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

Back when I started working with data I was using Python and I loved Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. I *needed* to use JavaScript though. When working in fullstack JS the context switch to a different language is a burden and it doesn't make sense. I wanted the sophistication of Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, *but in JavaScript!* It sounds crazy, but that's the kind of project that I love.

Well I'm working on [Data-Forge Notebook](http://www.data-forge-notebook.com/) now and I'm collecting interest from the JS community.
