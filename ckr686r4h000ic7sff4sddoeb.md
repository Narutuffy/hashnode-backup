## Great article!


I have a question though. In case of infinite scroll view, we keep adding items at the end of a list and it renders only those items which are visible.

What about the size of array we are using? I guess list is keeping track of elements with key or something and array size is increasing as we keep adding the elements into it. Can we do something about that?
