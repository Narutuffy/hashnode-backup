## Updated the config file, still same issue. I’m getting a warning:


`Loader function passed to ‘configure’ should return void or an array of module exports that all contain a ‘default’ export. Received: [{“default”:{“includeStories”:[],”parameters”:{“docs”:{}}}},{}]`

I went through github issues and tried all the solutions listed there, still no luck.
