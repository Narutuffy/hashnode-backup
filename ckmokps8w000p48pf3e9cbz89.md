## Draw an iceberg

If you want to have fun. Draw an iceberg and see how it will float. 

Icebergs are less dense than water, so they always float with about 10% of their mass above the water. But which way up? An iceberg wouldnâ€™t float exactly like on this page in reality. Its three-dimensional distribution of mass and its relative density compared to the water are both significant factors that are only approximated here.
