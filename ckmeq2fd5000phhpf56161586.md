## How to Fix the React useState Hook Not Setting Initial Value Problem?

The `useState` hook lets us create state variables in our React components.

It takes an argument for the initial value of the state.

Sometimes, we may want to set the initial value of a state from props.

And we want to update the initial value when the prop value changes.

In this article, we’ll look at how to fix the React `useState` hook with the latest prop value.

### Updating a State When a Prop Updates

To update a state when a prop updates, we’ve to watch the prop value with the `useEffect` hook.

Then in the `useEffect` callback, we can call the state setter function to update the state value with the prop’s value.

For instance, we can write:

    import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
    
    const Count = ({ count }) => {
      const [num, setNum] = useState(count);
    
      useEffect(() => {
        setNum(count);
      }, [count]);
    
      return <p>{num}</p>;
    };
    
    export default function App() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    
      return (
        <div className="App">
          <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>increment</button>
          <Count count={count} />
        </div>
      );
    }
    

In the `Count` component, we have the `useState` hook with the `count` value as the argument.

This sets `num` to `count` initially.

Then we have the `useEffect` hook that watches the `count` value by passing it into the array in the 2nd argument.

Then in the callback, we call `setNum` to update the `num` value and render that in the return statement below that.

In `App` , we have the `count` state created with the `useState` hook.

Then we call `setCount` in the `onClick` handler of the button which updates the value of the `count` state.

And we pass the `count` value as the value of the `count` prop in the `Count` component.

Now when we click on the increment button, we see the `num` value update and the latest value of it displayed.

### Conclusion

We can make sure that a React component state updates when the prop value changes by watching the prop’s value with the `useEffect` hook and then call the state setter function in the `useEffect` callback with the prop’s value as its argument.
