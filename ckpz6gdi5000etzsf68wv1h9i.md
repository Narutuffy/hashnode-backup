## CodeIgniter - Bonfire - Recommended Reading


*CodeIgniter Bonfire*, what it is and what it is not....

Bonfire is a Bare bones Admin panel for CodeIgniter projects, there are plenty of features in Bonfire such as HMVC, Events,
Migrations ( think Version Control but for your Database ), Assets management, Template library, the list goes on.  

Bonfire is not a Pre-made CMS, Blog, Shopping Cart, or any other web application.  It was created as a Jump-start for
your web applications.  We provide you the basic tools to work with, *YOU* use those tools to make your
web application.    


I personally have created, CMS's, simple Form Wizards, etc with it and have migrated legacy code using the Module Builder
to take pre-existing tables and build off of them.  I personally have been involved with Bonfire since it came out in one
way or another.  I am currently a Developer of Bonfire, and have been working hard on fixing bugs, and making a easy to use
Bootstrap based theme so that it is easier for developers to build with.   


Before you dive into Bonfire, you really need to read the Documentation on CodeIgniter, Bonfire, the HMVC Extension, and
learning Twitter's Bootstrap CSS and Java-Script would highly help you out.   

I'm gonna list out a few links to useful resources that I have found very useful in understanding Bonfire.

 - [Bonfire Docs](http://cibonfire.com/docs/) 
 - [Un-Completed Bonfire Guides](http://guides.cibonfire.com/)
 - [CodeIgniter User Guide](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/) 
 - [HMVC Extension Manual -> Read this, most of you skipped it.](https://bitbucket.org/wiredesignz/codeigniter-modular-extensions-hmvc/wiki/Home)
 - [Twitter CSS Documents](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)

*Hopefully* These links will help you out on your quest to understanding Bonfire.
