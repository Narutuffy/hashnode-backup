## Hi Michael,


I’m trying to use storybook for the design-system I’m working on but the mdx stories are not appearing on web. I have one .mdx and one .js story and I can only see the .js one. I followed the guide and updated webpack configuration also. Tbh, I am stuck at this since few days and couldn’t figure out what’s the issue. I am not seeing any error, stories are compiling fine but I guess storybook is somehow ignoring .mdx files. These are docs generated by Button.stories.js file but ActionButton.stories.mdx is totally missing.

Can you please take a look at my configuration and help me out?
